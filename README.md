# cadent
Given a text file as input, output a report that counts how many of each character (from ‘a’ to ‘z’) are at the beginning of all of the lines.  Use any programming language such as  bash, python, ruby.  
 

For example, if a text file has this:

 

--

alpha

anchor

azure

beta

dog

egg

envelope

--

Then the output should print a report that looks something like this:

--

a,3

b,1

d,1

e,2
